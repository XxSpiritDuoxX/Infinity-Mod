# Information
If you are looking for a mod with much more extended gameplay,then the Infinity Mod is for you,this mod was originally named ReAdvanced Mod but was renamed,unlike most other mods,Infinity will add LOTS more Units and Buildings,not just 10 - 20 more buildings and units,but im planning to make this mod have 100+ Units and Buildings,along with some mini mods for this,for now i dont have much to offer here,but in the future i will add much more

## Planning to add
1. Resizer Byte (Minimod)|| Mid game item that can be used to build basic buildings but being able to make them either 1 block larger or smaller

2. Many units

3. Many Buildings

4. Bees (Unit)|| Low HP but stupidly fast flying units that dont deal much damage

5. Black Hole (Unit)|| super slow but has INSANE amount of HP,anything near it will have its hp quickly reduced (hence,black hole)
